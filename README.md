# Project6
This is a mock web page for a tech company call TechBug that edits code and eliminates bugs in programs.


The typer for the text is javascript.
The animation for the logo is jQuery.

CSS3 was used for the styling of the web page.

I did use a typer code found on the web for the animation so credits go to https://steven.codes/typerjs/
a friend recommended it to me years ago and I have been using it ever since on some of my projects and assignments to spring up the design.
